            <h2>Creatures</h2>
            <p>Creatures represent warriors, minions, beasts and monsters that serve the player, usually by fighting on his or her behalf. Because almost all creatures can attack each turn to reduce an opponent's life, or block the opponent's attackers, creature cards are fundamental to most deck strategies.</p>

        <div id="enchantment">
            <h2>Enchantments</h2>
            <p>Enchantments represent persistent magical effects, usually remaining in play indefinitely. Most have continuous or triggered abilities, but some have abilities that can be activated by their controllers</p>

        <div id="instant">
            <h2>Instants</h2>
            <p>Instants, like sorceries, represent one-shot or short-term magical spells. They are never put into the in-play zone; instead, they take effect when their mana cost is paid and the spell resolves, and then are immediately put into the player's graveyard.</p>

        <div id="land">
            <h2>Lands</h2>
            <p>Lands represent locations under the player's control, most of which can be used to generate mana. Because mana is needed to use almost any card or ability, most decks need a high number of mana-producing lands (typically between 33-40% of the total deck) in order to function effectively.</p>

        <div id="sorcery">
            <h2>Sorcery</h2>
            <p>Sorceries, like instants, represent one-shot or short-term magical spells. They are never put into the in-play zone; instead, they take effect when their mana cost is paid and the spell resolves, and then are immediately put into the player's graveyard.</p>

        <div id="artifact">
            <h2>Artifact</h2>
            <p>Artifacts are permanents that represent magical items, animated constructs, pieces of equipment, or other objects and devices</p>

        <div id="planeswalker">
            <h2>Planeswalker</h2>
            <p>Planeswalkers enter the battlefield with a set number of loyalty counters, printed in the lower right of the card. A planeswalker can be attacked, like a player, or be dealt damage by an opponent redirecting the damage one of his or her spells would deal to the player controlling the planeswalker. Damage dealt to a planeswalker removes that many loyalty counters and a Planeswalker with no loyalty counters is put into the graveyard.</p>
